# Risk evaluation with key species
In this part, we quantify the risk by regarding the key species of ecosystem as critical natural assets. We here give the example in our research: By focusing on the sardine and anchocvy in 6 ocean currents all around world, we analyze the risk of these areas.

## Research area

<img src="./illustration_figs/currents.png">

with expanding the 3 risk components to the portfolio view, we have:
<p align="center">$$R_{species} = \left( MCI_{asset1} \times \frac{\Delta M}{\Delta asset1} \times MCI_{asset2} \times \frac{\Delta M}{\Delta asset2} \right) \times H \times PE$$</p>
<p align="center">$$R_{ecosystem} = \frac{(MCI_{a1→a2} \times \Delta M_{a1} \times H_{a1} + MCI_{a2→a1} \times \Delta M_{a2} \times H_{a2})}{PE_{ecosystem}}$$</p>
here, the $MCI$ is the causal interaction strength between two assets, and $asset1$ as well $asset2$ indicates for the assets that interact with specific species.

# Ecohydrological-Portfolio-Risk-Model
a model to quantify ecohydrological risk based on portfolio of natural assets

## Model
We propose our model based on following original definition of risk:
<p align="center">$$Risk=probability ×F(hazards,exposure,vulnerability)$$</p>
with expanding the 3 risk components to the portfolio view, we have:
<p align="center">$$R_S,R_A=(〖MCI〗_SST× ∆B/∆SST×〖MCI〗_SLR×∆B/∆SLR)×H×PE$$</p>
